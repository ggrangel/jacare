    /**
    Hosted zones are used to add and store DNS records, which are
    instructions within DNS servers that provide information about a domain,
    including what IP address it is associated with, and how to handle requests for it.
    There are several types of DNS records, including:
    - A records: Maps a domain to an IPv4 address.
    - AAAA records: Maps a domain to an IPv6 address.
    - CNAME records: Maps a domain to another domain (does not provide the IP adress)
    - MX records: Maps a domain to a mail server.
      -  A mail server is a server that sends and receives email.
    - NS records: Maps a domain to a name server.
      - A name server is a server that translates domain names into IP addresses.
    - TXT records: Used to store arbitrary text data. 
    - SOA records: Stores information about the DNS/Hosted zone.

    Pricing: 
    - $0.50 per hosted zone per month for the first 25 hosted zones.
    - $0.40 per million queries â€“ first 1 billion queries / month.
